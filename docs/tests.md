# Test plan

Per-feature test catalog for `tg_notes`. When a feature is picked up for
implementation, add a section here listing its concrete tests **before** writing code
(see the Testing policy in [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)). Each test is tagged by group:

- **(a) Fully automated** — runs in GitHub Actions CI on every push/PR. Scripts live in
  [../auto-tests/](../auto-tests/) and are wired into CI. Claude analyses the run logs
  even when green.
- **(b) Dev-machine / AI-sandbox** — runnable only on a developer machine (audio/whisper,
  KeePassXC / Secret Service, live Telegram) or not fully automatable; run in an isolated
  sandbox under Claude's control (`scripts/sandbox.py`, `TG_NOTES_LIVE=1`).
- **(c) Human-in-the-loop** — needs a human; Claude writes a methodology and hands it over.

Per-test pass/fail status for the **current** feature is tracked in
[../TODO.md](../TODO.md); a feature is done only when 100% of its tests pass (group-(c)
methodology proposed).

## Baseline (delivered features 1–14)

The shipped suite (`pytest`, 121+ tests) plus the gated live tests
(`TG_NOTES_LIVE=1`) already cover the delivered features. New feature sections are
appended below as work is picked up.
